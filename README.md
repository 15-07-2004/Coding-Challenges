# 30 Days Coding Challenge Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing solutions to the coding questions from the 30-day challenge organized by Arsh Goyal. These questions are commonly asked in product-based companies, including FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), and are excellent preparation for technical interviews.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the coding questions provided in the challenge. Each solution is implemented in C++. I've included the most optimal solution along with explanations where necessary.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have alternative solutions to any of the challenges or suggestions for improving existing solutions, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Arsh Goyal for organizing this coding challenge and providing valuable practice questions for technical interviews.
